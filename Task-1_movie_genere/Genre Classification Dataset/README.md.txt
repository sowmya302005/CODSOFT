# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification — CODSOFT ML Task 1

This project is part of the **CODSOFT Machine Learning Internship**.

## 📖 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **predict the genre of a movie** based on its **plot summary** using Machine Learning techniques.  
We use text processing methods like **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** and classification algorithms such as **Logistic Regression**.
